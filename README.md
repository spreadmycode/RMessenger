FAST: RMessenger is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed                network of data centers around the globe.

  * UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the RMessenger cloud for as long as you need it.

  * SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on RMessenger, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.

  * POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 50 members, share media files, and even set up bots for specific tasks. It is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

  * RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, RMessenger is the most reliable messaging system ever made.

  * SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, RMessenger is lean and easy to use.

  * 100% FREE & NO ADS: RMessenger is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

  * PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, RMessenger offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices.
